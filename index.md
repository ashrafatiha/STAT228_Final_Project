      <h2>Streaming the Future: Predicting Show Renewals with Data</h2>
      <p>
        This project explores the prediction of TV show renewals using various factors such as network affiliation, ratings, and popularity. The dataset includes information from over 5,000 TV shows, focusing on major U.S. streaming services. Through data wrangling, visualization, and modeling, the project aims to uncover patterns that could predict whether a show will be renewed or canceled. The analysis utilizes a logistic regression model to evaluate the influence of key predictors on renewal likelihood.
